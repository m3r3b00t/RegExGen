Algorithm to generate ReGex for given list of strings.

1. Sort strings lexciographically.
1.1 While scanning string store all unique chars from all strings. Useful in 3.1 and 4.
2. Group strings based on edit distance and string length.
   Omit string which edit distance is almost eq to len(string)
3. For each group find longest common subsequence.
   At end split that LCS to possible substrings of last string of group.
   Go to step 4.
3.1 If LCS is None then we need to cover all strings in input.
    Create unique_char_groups from unique_chars (created in 1.1) and find range.
    [unique_char_groups].{Range}
    Range will be {len(smallest_str_in_input), len(longest_str_in_input)}
4. Now create Regex based on substrings and (first, last) strings of group.

Result is depends on:
Threshold edit distance to change group. More threshold value bigger groups.
Min and Max length of strings.

Example walkthrough:
List of strings: {www.netskope.com, www.net.com, www.netscalar.com, www.google.com, hello world., www.network.com}
threshold_distance: 6

After first step:
{
 hello world.
 www.google.com
 www.netscalar.com
 www.netskope.com
 www.network.com
 www.net.com
}

After second step:
{
 www.netscalar.com
 www.netskope.com
 www.network.com
 www.net.com
}
Explanation:
 "hello world." will be omitted as edit_distance to "www.google.com" is len("www.google.com") > threshold_distance.
 "www.google.com" will be omitted as edit_distance (to "www.netscalar.com" is 9) > threshold_distance.
 "www.netscalar.com" will be begin of group as its edit_distance to "www.netskope.com" is 5. We found begin of group.
 "www.netskope.com" will be part of group as its  edit_distance to last and first string of group "www.netscalar.com" is 5.
 "www.network.com" will be part of group as its edit_distance to last string in group "www.netskope.com" is 5 and to first string "www.netscalar.com" in group is 6.
 "www.net.com" will be part of group as its edit_distance to last string in group "www.network.com" is 4 and to first string "www.netscalar.com" in group is 6.

After third step:
 LCS is "www.net.com", can be splitted to {"www.net", ".com"}
Process to split to substrs:
 Find first substr between first_string_of_group and LCS and repeat this by passing rest of strings.
 firstSubStr("www.netscalar.com", "www.net.com")should return ["www.net", 0, 7] #[substr, start_index, len]
   store ""www.net" as {"www.net"}
 firstSubStr("scalar.com", ".com")should return [".com", 6, 4] #[substr, start_index, len]
   store ".com" as {"www.net", ".com"}
 Now ".com"+len(i.e 4) become "" so we will stop finding substrs.
 
After fourth step:
 www\.net.{0,6}\.com

Process:
 In each substring for special charactres like '.' prepend escape sequence '\' and join substring by substring with ranges.
 Min_chars is Min distance between current two substrs
 Max_chars is Max distance between current two substrs
 Min_chars = 9999 Max_chars = 0
 For every string in group find distance 'd' between two substsrs ("www.net", ".com") 
 Min_chars = Min(Min_chars, d)
 Max_chars = Max(Max_chars, d)
 Min we get from "www.net.com" as 0.
 Max we get from "www.netscalar.com" as 6.
 www\.net.{Min_chars, Max_chars}\.com
 
Little realistic example:
{
 www.abcdefghijklmn.com
 www.netfdsayouskope.com
 www.xyz.com
 www.netheyou.com
 i'm noise
 www.google.com
 www.netreyouwork.com
 www.netscalaryou.com
 www.qwertyuiops1223.com
}
#threshold: 9

After second step
{
 www.netfdsayouskope.com
 www.netheyou.com
 www.netreyouwork.com
 www.netscalaryou.com
}
After third step
 ["www.net", "you", ".com"]
After fourth step
 www\.net.{2,6}.you.{0,5}.\.com

We can enhance algorithm to generate ReGexs for every group.

Case where LCS is None:
Consider input as {1000, 10000, 9999, 12345, 1000000, 10000000, 10000001}
Threshold: 8 (len of longest_str is 8 so we need to consider all inputs, no omission as noise)
Expected output: [0-5,9].{4,8}

Step 1:
 {1000, 10000, 1000000, 10000000, 10000001, 12345, 9999}
 unique_chars = [0,1,2,3,4,5,9]
 
Step 2:
 No grouping is required as Threshold_edit_distance == len(longest_str).
 Everything is single group.
 {1000, 10000, 1000000, 10000000, 10000001, 12345, 9999}
 
Step 3:
 LCS is ""

Step 3.1:
 unique_chars = [0,1,2,3,4,5,9] to unique_char_groups = [0-5,9]
 Range = {len(smallest_str), len(longest_str)} 

output: unique_char_groups.Range ==> [0-5,9].{4,8}

Consider input as {abcd, help, hello, whoami, elliot, mrrobot}
Threshold: 6
Expected output: [a-e,h-i, l-m, o-p, t, w].{4,7}

Step 1:
 {abcd, elliot, hello, help, mrrobot, whoami}
 unique_chars = [a,b,c,d,e,h,i,l,m,o,p,t,w]
 
Step 2:
 No grouping is required as Threshold_edit_distance == len(longest_str).
 Everything is single group.
 {abcd, elliot, hello, help, mrrobot, whoami}
 
Step 3:
 LCS is ""

Step 3.1:
 unique_chars = [a,b,c,d,e,h,i,l,m,o,p,t,w] to unique_char_groups = [a-e,h-i, l-m, o-p, t, w]
 Range = {len(smallest_str), len(longest_str)} 

output: unique_char_groups.Range ==> [a-e,h-i, l-m, o-p, t, w].{4,7}
